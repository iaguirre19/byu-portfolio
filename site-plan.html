      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
       <p>
    Projects are at the heart of my career and my passion. I've had the privilege of contributing to a variety of projects that showcase my skills and expertise. Here are three of the most noteworthy projects I've been a part of:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Project 1: Phone Book for California Auto Insurance Company</strong>
    This project involved the development of a comprehensive phone book system for a California-based auto insurance company. I played a pivotal role in creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system and a user login mechanism. Depending on their roles, users could access and manage company user information. This project demonstrated my ability to design and implement user-friendly systems for efficient data management.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Project 2: Human Resources Registration System</strong>
    Another significant project was the implementation of a Human Resources registration system. This project followed a uniform design scheme for consistency. I contributed to the development and maintenance of this system, ensuring a streamlined and efficient HR process. My involvement in this project highlighted my attention to detail and commitment to improving business processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Project 3: Technology Company Landing Page</strong>
    I had the pleasure of working on a landing page for a technology company based in California. This project allowed me to showcase my web design and development skills. The landing page was designed to create a compelling online presence for the company, emphasizing their services and mission. It was an exciting opportunity to fuse creativity with technology.
